1.When passing an array to a function it is by address as an argument to grant a function to an array and doest not allow copping the entire array.

2.while having an extra integer it is simpler to take variable thats not inside the function to use or make any changes to it. 

for eg
int searchInventory(const struct Book book[], const int isbn, const int size);
the int size parameter limits the function and the int isbn is used to match with the array so as to give the value needed.

3.Because “const” specify that it is an unmodifiable value that can not be changed by the user.
